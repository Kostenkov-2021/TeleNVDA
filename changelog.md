This release includes a new setting to mute remote speech when working on the local machine. Note that translations aren't updated while the NV Access translation system is paused. This release is declared as stable, and will be published on the NV Access store as soon as stable add-ons compatible with 2024.1 are allowed. No beta or dev versions will be released. If you want to update this add-on automatically, use the nvda.es store add-on for now.
